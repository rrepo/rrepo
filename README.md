Hi, I'm **rrepo**, a developer passionate about building experimental hardware, lightweight frontend tools, and developer productivity enhancements. Here are a few of my featured projects:

## 🎮 hand_game - Custom Keyboard Prototype

![hand_game](https://i.imgur.com/8W6ofcq.jpeg)

A custom 3D-printed keyboard designed for ergonomic typing and game-like input.  
This is still a **prototype**, but it’s fully functional and programmable with QMK.

### Highlights:
- Custom key layout (see [keyboard-layout-editor](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/))
- Printable STL files and source code available
- Modified with paper clay for angle correction and better typing stability

📦 [View QMK config and STL files](https://github.com/rrepo/hand_game)

> **Note**: Some printed parts required sanding and adjustments due to tight fits. This is documented in the repository.

### Key Features:
- Node creation, editing, deletion, and movement
- Zoom in/out of the entire view
- Flat object-array data structure for simplicity
- All layout handled with HTML/CSS – no canvas or coordinate math
