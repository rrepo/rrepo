# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Hi, I'm **rrepo**, a developer passionate about building experimental hardware, lightweight frontend tools, and developer productivity enhancements. Here are a few of my featured projects:

## 🎮 hand_game - Custom Keyboard Prototype

![hand_game](https://i.imgur.com/8W6ofcq.jpeg)

A custom 3D-printed keyboard designed for ergonomic typing and game-like input.  
This is still a **prototype**, but it’s fully functional and programmable with QMK.

### Highlights:
- Custom key layout (see [keyboard-layout-editor](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/))
- Printable STL files and source code available
- Modified with paper clay for angle correction and better typing stability

📦 [View QMK config and STL files](https://github.com/rrepo/hand_game)

> **Note**: Some printed parts required sanding and adjustments due to tight fits. This is documented in the repository.

## 🧠 Easy Mindmap

A lightweight and minimal mindmap rendering Vue application.  
No recursion. No coordinate calculations. Just fast and clean mindmaps.

![Easy Mindmap Demo](https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/easy-mindmap/blob/main/demo.gif](https://github.com/rrepo/easy-mindmap-renderer-demo/blob/main/demo.gif))

🔧 **Features:**
- Create / Edit / Move / Delete nodes
- Zoom in/out of the entire map
- Flat data structure (no recursion)
- Fully HTML/CSS-based layout (no JS coordinate math)

🌿 **Why It’s Different:**  
Unlike heavy mindmap libraries, this project avoids recursion and coordinate math entirely—keeping everything fast and minimal.
